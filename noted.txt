6. B D ? Each VPC contains a default security group that can’t be deleted. You can create a
security group by itself without attaching it to anything. But if you want to use it, you must
attach it to an ENI. You also attach multiple security groups to the same ENI.
7. A
8. B D? D. An Internet gateway has no management IP address. It can be associated with only one
VPC at a time and so cannot grant Internet access to instances in multiple VPCs. It is a
logical VPC resource and not a virtual or physical router.
9. A 
10. A
11. C A. An instance must have a public IP address to be directly reachable from the Internet.
The instance may be able to reach the Internet via a NAT device. The instance won’t
necessarily receive the same private IP address because it was automatically assigned.
The instance will be able to reach other instances in the subnet because a public IP is not
required.
12. B
13. A
14. D A. The NAT device’s default route must point to an Internet gateway, and the instance’s
default route must point to the NAT device. No differing NACL configurations between
subnets are required to use a NAT device. Security groups are applied at the ENI level. A
NAT device doesn’t require multiple interfaces.
15. A  
16. D A. An Internet gateway performs NAT for instances that have a public IP address. A route
table defines how traffic from instances is forwarded. An EIP is a public IP address and
can’t perform NAT. An ENI is a network interface and doesn’t perform NAT.
17. A
18. A
19. A D. Each peered VPC needs a route to the CIDR of its peer; therefore, you must create
two routes with the peering connection as the target. Creating only one route is not sufficient
to enable bidirectional communication. Additionally, the instances’ security groups
must allow for bidirectional communication. You can’t create more than one peering connection
between a pair of VPCs.
20. C A. Inter-region VPC peering connections aren’t available in all regions and support a maximum
MTU of 1,500 bytes. You can use IPv4 across an inter-region peering connection but
not IPv6.

Chapter 6:
1. B C. While each of the other answers represents possible concerns, none of them carries consequences
as disastrous as the complete loss of control over your account.
2. A B. The Action element refers to the kind of action requested (list, create, etc.), the Resource
element refers to the particular AWS account resource that’s the target of the policy, and the
Effect element refers to the way IAM should react to a request.
3. B C D A, B, C. Unless there’s a policy that explicitly allows an action, it will be denied. Therefore,
a user with no policies or with a policy permitting S3 actions doesn’t permit EC2 instance
permissions. Similarly, when two policies conflict, the more restrictive will be honored. The
AdministratorAccess policy opens up nearly all AWS resources, including EC2.
4. B C
5. A D  A, B. X.509 is the standard protocol for SOAP requests, but access keys are used for S3
and Amazon Mechanical Turk requests. Passwords are never used for encryption, just
authentication, and key pairs are generally used only for EC2 instances or for authenticating
signed URLS for CloudFront distributions
6. D
7. B
8. C
9. A Key Management Service manages encryption infrastructure but isn’t FIPS 140-2 compliant.
Security Token Service is used to issue tokens for valid IAM roles. And Secrets Manager
handles secrets for third-party services or databases.
10. B
11. A
12. A C A, D. You IAM policies will be as effective as ever, even if outsiders know your policies.
Since even an account’s root user would never have known other users’ passwords, there’s
no reason to change them.
13. B
14. B C
15. D STS tokens are used as temporary credentials to external identities for resource access
to through IAM roles. Users and groups would not use tokens to authenticate, and roles are
used to define the access a token will provide, not the recipient of the access
16. C
17. B D
18. B
19. A B C, D. An AWS managed service takes care of all underlying infrastructure management
for you. In this case, that will include data replication and software updates. On-premises
integration and multi-AZ deployment are important infrastructure features, but they’re not
unique to “managed” services.
20. B D C


Chapter 7:
1. A B D B, D. Creating a bucket and subnet are API actions, regardless of whether they’re performed
from the web console or AWS CLI. Uploading an object to an S3 bucket is a data
event, not a management event. Logging into the AWS console is a non-API management
event.
2. A C C. Data events include S3 object-level activity and Lambda function executions. Downloading
an object from S3 is a read-only event. Uploading a file to an S3 bucket is a writeonly
event and hence would not be logged by the trail. Viewing an S3 bucket and creating a
Lambda function are management events, not data events.
3. C  CloudTrail stores 90 days of event history for each region, regardless of whether
a trail is configured. Event history is specific to the events occurring in that region.
Because the trail was configured to log read-only management events, the trail logs
would not contain a record of the trail’s deletion. They might contain a record of who
viewed the trail, but that would be insufficient to establish who deleted it. There is no
such thing as an IAM user log
4. B
5. C Basic monitoring sends metrics every five minutes, while detailed monitoring sends them
every minute. CloudWatch can store metrics at regular or high resolution, but this affects
how the metric is timestamped, rather than the frequency with which it’s delivered to
CloudWatch.
6. D A. CloudWatch can store high-resolution metrics at subminute resolution. Therefore,
updating a metric at 15:57:08 and again at 15:57:37 will result in CloudWatch storing two
separate data points. Only if the metric were regular resolution would CloudWatch overwrite
an earlier data point with a later one. Under no circumstances would CloudWatch
ignore a metric update.
7. D Metrics stored at one-hour resolution age out after 15 months. Five-minute resolutions
are stored for 63 days. One-minute resolution metrics are stored for 15 days. High-resolution
metrics are kept for 3 hours.
8. B A. To graph a metric’s data points, specify the Sum statistic and set the period equal to the
metric’s resolution, which is in this case is five minutes. Graphing the Sum or Average statistic
over a one-hour period will not graph the metric’s data points but rather the Sum or
Average of those data points over a one-hour period. Using the Sample count statistic over a
five-minute period will yield a value of one for each period, since there’s only one data point
per period.
9. B 
10. D A, D. Every log stream must be in a log group. The retention period setting of a log group
controls how long CloudWatch retains log events within those streams. You can’t manually
delete log events individually, but you can delete all events in a log stream by deleting the
stream. You can’t set a retention period on a log stream directly.
11. A  A, C. CloudTrail will not stream events greater than 256 KB in size. There’s also a normal
delay, typically up to 15 minutes, before an event appears in a CloudWatch log stream.
Metric filters have no bearing on what log events get put into a log stream. Although a misconfigured
or missing IAM role would prevent CloudTrail from streaming logs to Cloud-
Watch, the question indicates that some events are present. Hence, the IAM role is correctly
configured.
12. D B, D. If an EBS volume isn’t attached to a running instance, EBS won’t generate any metrics
to send to CloudWatch. Hence, the alarm won’t be able to collect enough data points
to alarm. The evaluation period can be no more than 24 hours, and the alarm was created
two days ago, so the evaluation period has elapsed. The data points to monitor don’t have
to cross the threshold for CloudWatch to determine the alarm state.
13. B To have CloudWatch treat missing data as exceeding the threshold, set the Treat Missing
Data As option to Breaching. Setting it to Not Breaching will have the opposite effect.
Setting it to As Missing will cause CloudWatch to ignore the missing data and behave as
if those evaluation periods didn’t occur. The Ignore option causes the alarm not to change
state in response to missing data. There’s no option to treat missing data as Not Missing.
14. B C  C, D. CloudWatch can use the Simple Notification Service to send a text message. Cloud-
Watch refers to this as a Notification action. To reboot an instance, you must use an EC2
Action. The Auto Scaling action will not reboot an instance. SMS is not a valid Cloud-
Watch alarm action.
15. B A. The recover action is useful when there’s a problem with an instance that requires AWS
involvement to repair, such as a hardware failure. The recover action migrates the same
instance to a new host. Rebooting an instance assumes the instance is running and entails
the instance remaining on the same host. Recovering an instance does not involve restoring
any data from a snapshot, as the instance retains the same EBS volume(s).
16. A B. If CloudTrail were logging write-only management events in the same region as the
instance, it would have generated trail logs containing the deletion event. Deleting a log
stream containing CloudTrail events does not delete those events from the trail logs stored
in S3. Deleting an EC2 instance is not an IAM event. If AWS Config were tracking changes
to EC2 instances in the region, it would have recorded a timestamped configuration item
for the deletion, but it would not include the principal that deleted the instance.
17. C D  B, C, D. The delivery channel must include an S3 bucket name and may specify an SNS
topic and the delivery frequency of configuration snapshots. You can’t specify a Cloud-
Watch log stream.
18. D. You can’t delete configuration items manually, but you can have AWS Config delete them
after no less than 30 days. Pausing or deleting the configuration recorder will stop AWS Config
from recording new changes but will not delete configuration items. Deleting configuration
snapshots, which are objects stored in S3, will not delete the configuration items.
19.  C, D. CloudWatch can graph only a time series. METRICS()/AVG(m1) and m1/m2 both return
a time series. AVG(m1)-m1 and AVG(m1) return scalar values and can’t be graphed directly.
20. A B. Deleting the rule will prevent AWS Config from evaluating resources’ configurations
against it. Turning off the configuration recorder won’t prevent AWS Config from evaluating
the rule. It’s not possible to delete the configuration history for a resource from AWS
Config. When you specify a frequency for periodic checks, you must specify a valid frequency,
or else AWS Config will not accept the configuration.

Chapter 9:
1. A C. 99.95 percent availability translates to about 22 minutes of downtime per month, or
4 hours and 23 minutes per year. 99.999 percent availability is less than 30 seconds of
downtime per month, but the question calls for the minimum level of availability. 99 percent
yields more than 7 hours of downtime per month, while 99.9 percent is more than 43 minutes
of downtime per month.
2. 
3. B
4. A D  B, D. One cause of application failures is resource exhaustion. By scoping out large enough
instances and scaling out to make sure you have enough of them, you can prevent failure
and thus increase availability. Scaling instances in may help with cost savings but won’t
help availability. Storing web assets in S3 instead of hosting them from an instance can help
with performance but won’t have an impact on availability.
5. B
6. A
7. B A A, D, E. Auto Scaling monitors the health of instances in the group using either ELB or
EC2 instance and system checks. It can’t use Route 53 health checks. Dynamic scaling
policies can use CloudWatch Alarms, but these are unrelated to checking the health of
instances.
8. B C
9. A C A, D. Enabling versioning protects objects against data corruption and deletion by keeping
before and after copies of every object. The Standard storage class replicates objects across
multiple availability zones in a region, guarding against the failure of an entire zone. Bucket
policies may protect against accidental deletion, but they don’t guard against data corruption.
Cross-region replication applies to new objects, not existing ones.

14. A C D A, D. Two EC2 instances each with 2 private IP addresses would consume 100 IP addresses
in a subnet. Additionally, AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in every subnet. The subnet therefore
must be large enough to hold 105 IP addresses. 172.21.0.0/25 and 10.0.0.0/21 are
sufficiently large. 172.21.0.0/26 allows room for only 63 IP addresses. 10.0.0.0/8 is large
enough, but a subnet prefix length must be at least /16.
15. A C A, D. Direct Connect offers consistent speeds and latency to the AWS cloud. Because
Direct Connect bypasses the public Internet, it’s more secure.
