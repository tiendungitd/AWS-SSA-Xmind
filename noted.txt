6. B D ? Each VPC contains a default security group that can’t be deleted. You can create a
security group by itself without attaching it to anything. But if you want to use it, you must
attach it to an ENI. You also attach multiple security groups to the same ENI.
7. A
8. B D? D. An Internet gateway has no management IP address. It can be associated with only one
VPC at a time and so cannot grant Internet access to instances in multiple VPCs. It is a
logical VPC resource and not a virtual or physical router.
9. A 
10. A
11. C A. An instance must have a public IP address to be directly reachable from the Internet.
The instance may be able to reach the Internet via a NAT device. The instance won’t
necessarily receive the same private IP address because it was automatically assigned.
The instance will be able to reach other instances in the subnet because a public IP is not
required.
12. B
13. A
14. D A. The NAT device’s default route must point to an Internet gateway, and the instance’s
default route must point to the NAT device. No differing NACL configurations between
subnets are required to use a NAT device. Security groups are applied at the ENI level. A
NAT device doesn’t require multiple interfaces.
15. A  
16. D A. An Internet gateway performs NAT for instances that have a public IP address. A route
table defines how traffic from instances is forwarded. An EIP is a public IP address and
can’t perform NAT. An ENI is a network interface and doesn’t perform NAT.
17. A
18. A
19. A D. Each peered VPC needs a route to the CIDR of its peer; therefore, you must create
two routes with the peering connection as the target. Creating only one route is not sufficient
to enable bidirectional communication. Additionally, the instances’ security groups
must allow for bidirectional communication. You can’t create more than one peering connection
between a pair of VPCs.
20. C A. Inter-region VPC peering connections aren’t available in all regions and support a maximum
MTU of 1,500 bytes. You can use IPv4 across an inter-region peering connection but
not IPv6.
