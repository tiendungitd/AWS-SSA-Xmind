6. B D ? Each VPC contains a default security group that can’t be deleted. You can create a
security group by itself without attaching it to anything. But if you want to use it, you must
attach it to an ENI. You also attach multiple security groups to the same ENI.
7. A
8. B D? D. An Internet gateway has no management IP address. It can be associated with only one
VPC at a time and so cannot grant Internet access to instances in multiple VPCs. It is a
logical VPC resource and not a virtual or physical router.
9. A 
10. A
11. C A. An instance must have a public IP address to be directly reachable from the Internet.
The instance may be able to reach the Internet via a NAT device. The instance won’t
necessarily receive the same private IP address because it was automatically assigned.
The instance will be able to reach other instances in the subnet because a public IP is not
required.
12. B
13. A
14. D A. The NAT device’s default route must point to an Internet gateway, and the instance’s
default route must point to the NAT device. No differing NACL configurations between
subnets are required to use a NAT device. Security groups are applied at the ENI level. A
NAT device doesn’t require multiple interfaces.
15. A  
16. D A. An Internet gateway performs NAT for instances that have a public IP address. A route
table defines how traffic from instances is forwarded. An EIP is a public IP address and
can’t perform NAT. An ENI is a network interface and doesn’t perform NAT.
17. A
18. A
19. A D. Each peered VPC needs a route to the CIDR of its peer; therefore, you must create
two routes with the peering connection as the target. Creating only one route is not sufficient
to enable bidirectional communication. Additionally, the instances’ security groups
must allow for bidirectional communication. You can’t create more than one peering connection
between a pair of VPCs.
20. C A. Inter-region VPC peering connections aren’t available in all regions and support a maximum
MTU of 1,500 bytes. You can use IPv4 across an inter-region peering connection but
not IPv6.

Chapter 6:
1. B C. While each of the other answers represents possible concerns, none of them carries consequences
as disastrous as the complete loss of control over your account.
2. A B. The Action element refers to the kind of action requested (list, create, etc.), the Resource
element refers to the particular AWS account resource that’s the target of the policy, and the
Effect element refers to the way IAM should react to a request.
3. B C D A, B, C. Unless there’s a policy that explicitly allows an action, it will be denied. Therefore,
a user with no policies or with a policy permitting S3 actions doesn’t permit EC2 instance
permissions. Similarly, when two policies conflict, the more restrictive will be honored. The
AdministratorAccess policy opens up nearly all AWS resources, including EC2.
4. B C
5. A D  A, B. X.509 is the standard protocol for SOAP requests, but access keys are used for S3
and Amazon Mechanical Turk requests. Passwords are never used for encryption, just
authentication, and key pairs are generally used only for EC2 instances or for authenticating
signed URLS for CloudFront distributions
6. D
7. B
8. C
9. A Key Management Service manages encryption infrastructure but isn’t FIPS 140-2 compliant.
Security Token Service is used to issue tokens for valid IAM roles. And Secrets Manager
handles secrets for third-party services or databases.
10. B
11. A
12. A C A, D. You IAM policies will be as effective as ever, even if outsiders know your policies.
Since even an account’s root user would never have known other users’ passwords, there’s
no reason to change them.
13. B
14. B C
15. D STS tokens are used as temporary credentials to external identities for resource access
to through IAM roles. Users and groups would not use tokens to authenticate, and roles are
used to define the access a token will provide, not the recipient of the access
16. C
17. B D
18. B
19. A B C, D. An AWS managed service takes care of all underlying infrastructure management
for you. In this case, that will include data replication and software updates. On-premises
integration and multi-AZ deployment are important infrastructure features, but they’re not
unique to “managed” services.
